# Loan Prediction Analyzer

## Overview

The Loan Prediction Analyzer is a machine learning project developed using TensorFlow, Keras, and other relevant ML libraries. Its primary objective is to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their payments based on various features such as credit score, income, loan amount, and more. Through extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, the system aims to provide accurate predictions to financial institutions, aiding in risk assessment and decision-making processes. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess raw data to ensure quality and consistency.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and select the most relevant ones for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Generate predictions on new loan applications to aid in risk assessment.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **TensorFlow**: Machine learning framework for model building and training.
- **Keras**: High-level API for building and training neural networks.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
